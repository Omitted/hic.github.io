Muslims believe that death is a departure from the life of this world, but not the end of a person&rsquo;s existence.

It is requested that Muslims familiarize themselves with these issues at all times since death can approach anyone at any given time or place.<br><br>I ask Allah (SWT) to bestow on us sincerity in our speech and actions, to forgive our mistakes, and to place us with His pious servants; and for Him to listen and grant us what we ask for. We must always say — All praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds.<br><br><strong>What are important things that family members and friends should do when someone is dying?<br></strong>It is recommended by the Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) to do the following:<br><br>The dying person should be asked to pronounce, “Laa ilaaha illal Lah.” (There is no God but Allah.) before death. The prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) said: “Ask your dying fellows to pronounce, “Laa ilaaha illal Lah.” (There is no God but Allah.)” [Reported by Imams Muslim, Abu Dawood, At-Tirmithi, An-Nisa&rsquo;I and Ibn Majah]<br><br>The prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) said: “The one whose last words are “Laa Ilaaha Illal Lah.” (There is no God but Allah) will enter Paradise.” [Reported by Imams Abu Dawood]<br><br><strong>What should family members and friends do immediately after the death of their loved one?<br></strong><br>They should consult with a doctor or experienced professionals to ensure that the person has truly died and is not in a coma.<br><br>They should also supplicate and say “Inna Lillahi Wa inna ilaihi Raje&rsquo;oon.” (To Allah we belong, and to Him we will all return.) Allah (S.W.T.) says what can be translated as, “…Who, when afflicted with calamity, say:&rsquo; To Allah we belong, and to Him is our return.&rsquo; They are those on whom (descend) blessings from their Lord, and mercy. And they are the ones who receive guidance.” [Surat Al-Baqarah, verses (156,157)]<br><br>Um-Salama heard the prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) say: “Whomsoever is inflicted by a misfortune and then says: ‘Inna Lillahi wa inna ilaihi Raje&rsquo;oon, and then says, O&rsquo; Allah, reward me because of my misfortune, and bestow on me a better substitute,&rsquo; then Allah will reward him because of his misfortune and will bestow on him a better substitute.” Um-Salamah said: ‘When my husband, Abu-Salama died, I said what the messenger of Allah ordered me, so Allah bestowed on me a better substitute, the Messenger of Allah (S.A.W.).” [Reported by Imams Muslim and Ahmad]<br><br>Those near the deceased should also close the dead person&rsquo;s eyelids. The Messenger of Allah went to see Abu-Salama after he died; he found his eyes open, so the Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) closed them and said: “When the soul is retrieved, the sight follows it.” [Reported by Imam Muslim] They should also cover the dead. The prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) upon his death was wrapped with a piece of striped cloth.” [Reported by Imams Bukhari and Muslim] According to all scholars, it is permissible to kiss the dead and to cry for him, because the prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) kissed Othman Bin Math&rsquo;oon and cried for him until the tears wet his two cheeks when he died.” [Reported by Imams At-Tirmthi and Ibn Majah]<br><br>Also, Abu-Bakr (R.A.) kissed the Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) between his eyes after his death and said: “O&rsquo; Prophet, O&rsquo; Dear Friend”<br><br>They should also hasten in preparation for the Islamic burial. They must contact the Cemetery and Burial Committee members of the Huntsville Islamic Center .<br><br>The family or friends of the deceased should pay off the debts of the dead person from the wealth that he has left, or by donations to pay off his debt if there is no wealth left. Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) said: “The believer&rsquo;s soul is attached to his debt until it is paid,” [Reported by Imams Ahmad, Ibn Majah, and At-Tirmithi] meaning that the dead person&rsquo;s soul will not rest until his debt is paid.<br><br>They should also notify the relatives and friends of the deceased about the death: that the Prophet (S.A.W.) announced the death of Al-Najashi (the ruler of Ethiopia) on the same day of his death to the people. He also gathered people in the mosque, lined them up, and made four Takbeerat, (meaning: they prayed the Janazah prayer which consists of saying “Allah Akbar” four times). [Reported by Imams, Bukhari, Muslim and others] the prophet (S.A.W.) announced the death of Zaid, J&rsquo;afar, and Ibn-Rawaha (R.A.) before he received news of their death from the people. [Reported by Imams Bukhari and Ahmad]<br><br>It is permissible to cry after the death, but not permissible to yell or weep: Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) said: “Allah does not punish a person as a result of tears, or of the sorrow of the heart, but Allah punishes or bestows His mercy as a result of this.” And the, prophet pointed to his tongue. The Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) cried because of the death of his son, Ibrahim, and said:” The eye tear and the heart grieve, and we say nothing except what pleases our Lord, and we grieve as a result of your departure, Ibrahim.” [Reported by Imams, Bukhari and Muslim]<br><br>It is permissible for the woman to mourn the death of her relative for three days: (Mourning includes giving up perfume, jewelry, Kuhl, etc.); it is forbidden for her to mourn for more than three days except if it was her husband in which case she has to mourn, at home, throughout the “Iddah” waiting period, which is four months and ten days. The Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) said: “The woman must not mourn for more than three days except for her husband where she must mourn for four months and ten days.” [Reported by Imams Bukhari, Muslim and the six Imams except At-Tirmithi]<br><br>It is recommended that food be prepared for the deceased&rsquo;s family. The Prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.) said when J&rsquo;afar (R.A.) died: “Prepare food for the family of J&rsquo;afar, for they have been inflicted by a matter that occupied them.” [Reported by Imams Abu Dawood, Ibn-Majah, and At-Tirmithi] .<br><br><strong>How should the preparations begin for the Islamic burial?<br></strong><br>Preparing the dead for burial is a “Fard Kifayah” duty, meaning that if some Muslims properly carry out this duty, then other Muslims are exempt from the responsibility. Preparing the dead for burial consists of the following: Bathing the dead, wrapping the body with a shroud, praying for the dead, and burying the body. The Huntsville Islamic Center&rsquo;s, Cemetery and Burial Committee will make all the necessary arrangements in consultation with the family members of the deceased. Hence, it is important that the family members contact the Cemetery and Burial committee as soon as possible.<br><br><strong>How is the bathing of the dead (Ghusl) carried out?<br></strong><br>Volunteers at the HIC are trained to carry out this procedure and will help you as needed. The following information is for your help.<br><br>Deceased males should be washed by men, while deceased females should be washed by women. It is permissible for either spouse to wash the other after death.<br><br>It is obligatory to wash the whole body once with water with the intention of bathing the dead.<br><br>It is recommended that the body be laid on an elevated platform off of the floor, the body stripped of its clothes, and the private parts of both male and female be fully covered. Those bathing the body should press the abdomen of the deceased to release any impurities. Impurities should be removed and washed off of the body. The person should wrap a cloth around his/her hand to wash the private parts of the dead, since touching the private parts is forbidden. Then, perform ablution to the dead, meaning the dead is washed as if he were to perform ablution. Then the body is washed three times with water and soap starting with the right side.<br><br>If the deceased were a woman and her hair is braided, then her braids should be loosened and washed, and then braided back in three separate braids that go down her back. If there are any hair clips, bows, or bands, they should be removed before washing the hair.<br>After the bathing is done, the body should be dried with a clean cloth and perfumed. Only the people who are needed for carrying out this process should attend.<br><br><strong>When can Tayammum [dry Wash] be performed on the deceased?<br></strong><br>We should also know that Tayammum [dry wash] for the dead person can substitute washing the body in any case when water is not available or the place for washing the dead person is not available, or if there are no tools available for washing the dead person.<br><br>Also, it is permissible if there is a concern that the body will disintegrate if touched by water such as in cases of burn victims. We could also use Tayammum [dry wash] for deceased females if there are no women available to wash her body, and the same goes for men, if there are no men available to wash their bodies.<br><br><strong>How is Tayammum [dry wash] performed for the dead person?<br></strong><br>The person performing the Tayammum [dry wash] should tap one hand on any materials from the earth, such as stones, marble, bricks, sand, or soil. Then he should wipe his hand over the whole face of the deceased person. He then should tap material&rsquo;s from the earth again with one hand and wipe each hand of the deceased person up to his/her wrist.<br><br><strong>How is the Kafan (shroud) prepared and placed?<br></strong><br>Trained members of the community will help you with this. It is obligatory that the body be covered by at least a single shroud.<br><br><strong>Recommendations about the shroud<br></strong><br>A clean shroud is used.<br><br>A white shroud is used, because the Prophet (S.A.W.) said, “Wear white clothing it is the best of your clothes, and wrap the dead with it.” [Reported by Imam Abu Dawood, Tirmidhi, and Ibn Majah]<br><br>The shroud is perfumed. The Prophet (S.A.W) ordered a group of women to wash his deceased daughter three times and for the third time, add Kafoor” (a good smelling substance).” [Reported by Imams Bukhari, Muslim, and others]<br><br>The shroud consists of three pieces for the male, and of five pieces for the female, at the most. This limit was placed because “The prophet (S.A.W.) himself was shrouded by the companions in three white sheets.” [Reported by Imams Bukhari, Muslim, and others]<br><br><strong>How is the “Salatul Janazah” performed?<br></strong><br>All the requirements that are observed in regular prayers should be observed here (i.e. ablution, facing Qibla, etc.)<br>The Janazah (funeral prayer) has six essentials:<br><br>Intention to pray the Janazah prayer lies in the heart.<br>Standing up for prayer for those who are capable of doing so.<br>After the first Takbeerah recite surat (Al-Fatiha) silently.<br>After the second Takbeerah, saying a prayer for prophet Muhammad (S.A.W.).<br>After the third Takbeerah supplicating to Allah (S.W.T.) for the deceased.<br>After the fourth Takbeerah, make “Tasleem” saying: “Assalamu Alaikum Warahmatullah” and turning your head to the right. It is optional to add another Tasleem to the left side.<br></p></div><div class="col"></div></div></div></div><!-- bloc-9 END --><!-- ScrollToTop Button --><a class="bloc-button btn btn-d scrollToTop" onclick="scrollToTarget('1',this)"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="22" height="22" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path class="scroll-to-top-btn-icon" d="M30,22.656l-14-13-14,13"/></svg></a><!-- ScrollToTop Button END--><!-- footer-1 --><div class="bloc l-bloc" id="footer-1"><div class="bloc-shape-divider bloc-divider-top"><svg class="svg-divider bloc-divider-t-style" fill-rule="evenodd" preserveAspectRatio="none" viewBox="0 0 1000 250"><path d="M0,125H1000V250H0V125Z"></path></svg></div><div class="container bloc-lg bloc-sm-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><h4 class="mg-md text-sm-left text-center">About</h4><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link">The Team</a><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link">Contact Us</a></div><div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><h4 class="mg-md text-sm-left text-center">Get the app</h4><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link">Android</a><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link">iOS</a></div><div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><h4 class="mg-md text-sm-left text-center">Follow Us</h4><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link">Twitter</a><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link">Facebook</a></div><div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6"><h4 class="mg-md text-sm-left text-center">Company</h4><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link">Terms of use</a><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link">Privacy</a></div></div></div></div><!-- footer-1 END --><!-- footer-2 --><div class="bloc l-bloc" id="footer-2"><div class="container bloc-lg bloc-no-padding-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col-sm-10 offset-sm-1 col-md-8 offset-md-2 col-lg-6 offset-lg-3"><p class="text-lg-center">© Huntsville Islamic Center<br></p></div></div></div></div><!-- footer-2 END --></div><!-- Main container END -->  <!-- Additional JS --><script src="../js/jquery-3.5.1.min.js?5627"></script><script src="../js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js?3974"></script><script src="../js/blocs.min.js?281"></script><script src="../js/lazysizes.min.js" defer></script><!-- Additional JS END --></body></html>
